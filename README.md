# Bank Customer Churn Analysis & Recommendation Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn within a banking institution. Leveraging key demographic, financial, and behavioral data, the report identifies the primary drivers behind customer attrition and offers actionable recommendations to enhance customer retention strategies. This project showcases proficiency in data visualization, DAX formula creation, and the ability to translate complex data into clear, business-centric insights.

## My Contributions & Enhancements

While the foundational concepts for this project were inspired by a Power BI tutorial, I significantly expanded upon it by developing a more in-depth analytical framework and an actionable insights layer. My key contributions include:

* **Actionable Key Findings & Recommendations Page:** Developed a dedicated "Key Findings and Recommendations" page that translates raw data patterns into specific, prioritized business insights and proposes concrete retention strategies, demonstrating the ability to drive strategic decision-making from data.
* **Granular Product-Level Churn Analysis:** Designed dynamic "Churn Analysis" pages allowing users to filter and analyze churn metrics (Credit Card Status, Credit Score, Active Status, Account Balance) independently for each product. This provides a more detailed understanding of churn factors specific to individual product offerings.
* **Enhanced Customer Overview Dashboard:** Created a comprehensive "Customer Overview" page that dynamically displays demographic distributions (Country, Gender, Age Group, Tenure) for "All," "Churned," and "Not Churned" customer segments. This offers a holistic view of customer segments prone to churn.
* **Refined Visual Design and Interactivity:** Implemented a clean, consistent, and intuitive visual design with clear filtering options and effective use of color palettes to highlight churned vs. non-churned customers, enhancing user experience and report readability.

## Technologies Used

* **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, visualization, and report creation.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating custom measures and calculated columns to derive key insights and metrics.
